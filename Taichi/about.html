<h2 class="about">Something about Tai Chi</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Chi, also called Tai Chi Chuan, is a noncompetitive, self-paced system of gentle physical exercise and stretching. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often described as meditation in motion, Tai Chi promotes serenity through gentle, flowing movements. It involves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Chi has many different styles. Each style may subtly emphasize various Tai Chi principles and methods. There are variations within each style. Some styles may focus on health maintenance, while others focus on the martial arts aspect of Tai Chi."</p>

<h2 class="about">Great Benefits of Tai Chi</h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Chi  helps reduce stress and anxiety. And it also helps increase flexibility and balance.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Chi  is low impact and puts minimal stress on muscles and joints, making it generally safe for all ages and fitness levels.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Chi  requires no special equipment. You can do Tai Chi anywhere, including indoors or outside. And you can do Tai Chi alone or in a group class.</p>
